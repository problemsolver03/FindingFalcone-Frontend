Good attempt at solving the problem. The UI is very well designed.
** Thank you :)

Areas of Improvement:

**Done removed code repetition of choice component
Code repetition could have been avoided for the Choice component

**Done added a config file and loading api endpoints from there
Hard-coding of the API url could be avoided

**Done have broken down several components into smaller pieces and moved the respective css into respective components
The components could have been broken down further to make it more reusable and improve maintainability

**Done fixed this issue
The app seems to show incorrect values for vehicles if one selects value for the drop-downs and then does a reset plan

Additional stuff
Tried writing a few basic tests
